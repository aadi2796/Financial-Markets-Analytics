In this comprehensive endeavor, a thorough stock market data analysis was performed, delving into the intricacies of financial data to extract the OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for a diverse array of stock tickers and time frames. The robust Snowflake Virtual Warehouse served as the efficient and reliable repository for this extensive data, ensuring seamless accessibility and management throughout the project.

To delve deeper into the technical aspects of the analysis, Python programming language was expertly employed, alongside the powerful TA-Lib library, enabling the application of sophisticated technical analysis techniques. In particular, a custom function was meticulously crafted to identify the convergence and divergence patterns of the Average Directional Index (ADX) and Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO). This bespoke tool facilitated the detection of key turning points and trends, aiding in the identification of potential trading opportunities.

Furthermore, the investigation extended to the study of price behavior following the occurrence of divergence patterns. This in-depth exploration yielded invaluable insights into the management of risks associated with trades. Armed with this knowledge, market participants were better equipped to make informed decisions, effectively mitigating potential risks and maximizing potential rewards.

By skillfully combining advanced data extraction, storage, and analysis techniques, this project provided a comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of stock market dynamics. The utilization of cutting-edge tools and the development of custom functions demonstrated the depth of expertise and commitment to uncovering significant patterns, contributing to the advancement of risk management strategies in the realm of stock trading.
